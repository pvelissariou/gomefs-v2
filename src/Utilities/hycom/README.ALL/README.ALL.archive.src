hycom/ALL/archive/src/README.ALL.archive.src:

Domain-independent source code for modifying HYCOM archive files, and 
for converting them to other file formats.

Some common source files are hardlinked to those in hycom/ALL/libsrc.  
Replicating these files in all source directories avoids issues with 
compiler-dependent module processing.

mod_plot.F and several other source routines are identical to those
in ../../plot/src, because both sets of programs are doing similar 
archive "processing".  These are not hardlinked together, so any
modifications in one directory must be manually propagated to the other.

All programs read regional.grid.b at run-time to get idm and jdm for the 
particular region being processed.

The Makefile is configured to key on ../../config/$(ARCH)_setup for
machine-dependent definitions, see ../../config/README.ALL.config.  When 
running on (say) a Linux PC, ARCH is "intel" and an individual make 
command might be:  make hycomproc ARCH=intel >& Make_hycomproc

Typically all (non-netCDF) executables are created just once by editing 
Make_all.src for the correct ARCH and then issuing the command 
csh Make_all.com.

Executables that use the netCDF library (version 3.5) are created just 
once by editing ALL/Make_ncdf.src for the correct root directory and then 
issuing the command  csh Make_ncdf.com.  The netCDF library is at:
    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/
These are optional, ignore Make_ncdf.com if you don't want to use NetCDF.

The program hycomarchv will convert a MICOM or HYCOM 1.0 archive file 
to HYCOM 2.0.  Note that hycomarchv can also be used to create a correct 
".b" file for a HYCOM 2.0 archive file (e.g. if the original .b file has 
been deleted).

The program trim_archv will modify the number of layers in a HYCOM 2.0 
archive file.  It is primarily used in the process of generating 
sub-region archive files for nested boundary conditions, e.g. when the 
nested (sub-region) domain has a subset of the layers used by the 
enclosing domain.  Layers can only be added at the top of the water 
column (e.g. for converting isopycnal cases to a hybrid vertical
coordinate), or removed at the bottom of the water column (e.g. to
remove dense layers that don't exist in the sub-region).  See also,
hycom/ALL/subregion.

The program mrgl_archv also modifies the number of layers in a 
HYCOM 2.0 archive file, by combining several layers into one layer.
It is primarily used diagnostically, e.g. to plot a water mass that
consists of several layers.

The program archv2data2d extracts 2-d diagnostic fields from an
archive file.  All the horizontal (x-y) fields that can be plotted
with hycomproc can be written out by archv2data2d and like hycomproc
the output can be for a sub-region.  Output can be formatted, 
unformatted (BINARY), or .[ab] (HYCOM).  Note that HYCOM .a files can 
be converted to "raw" files with an arbitrary data void value using
ALL/bin/hycom2raw.

The program archv2data3z interpolates hybrid layers from an archive 
file to fixed depths.  Like hycomproc, the output can be for a 
sub-region.  Output can be formatted, unformatted (BINARY), or 
.[ab] (HYCOM).  Note that HYCOM .a files can be converted to "raw" 
files with an arbitrary data void value using ALL/bin/hycom2raw.

The programs archv2ncdf2d and archv2ncdf3z are identical to archv2data2d
and archv2data3z, except that they also allows netCDF output.  The
source code is identical except horout.f vs horout_nc.f.  They are 
separate executables because some sites might not have netCDF.

One application of archv2*2d and archv2*3z is to allow the use of
alternatives to NCAR Graphics (and hycomproc).  Just create diagnostic
files in the data format of your choice and inport them into your
favorite graphics package.
