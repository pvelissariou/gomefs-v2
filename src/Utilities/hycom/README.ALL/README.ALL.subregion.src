hycom/ALL/subregion/src/README.subregion.src:

Domain-independent source code for extraction of a subregion from an 
archive file or from a bathymetry or any hycom p-grid ".a" file.  
The mapping is via bilinear interpolation and the location of the source 
grid on the target grid is pre-calculated and stored in a "gmap" file.

Earlier versions of these programs were limited to target grids with
the same grid resolution as the original, or which were finer than the 
original by an integer multiplier.  These are replaced by the isubx_gmap
program for setting up the gmap file for such cases.

Some common source files are hardlinked to those in hycom/ALL/libsrc.  
Replicating these files in all source directories avoids issues with 
compiler-dependent module processing.

All programs read regional.grid.b at run-time to get idm and jdm for the 
particular region being processed.

The Makefile is configured to key on ../../config/$(ARCH)_setup for
machine-dependent definitions, see ../../config/README.config.  When 
running on (say) a Linux PC, ARCH is "intel" and an individual make 
command might be:  make map ARCH=intel >& Make_map

Typically all executables are created just once by editing Make_all.src 
for the correct ARCH and then issuing the command csh Make_all.com.
