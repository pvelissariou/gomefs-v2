The latest (HYCOM) atmospheric forcing program (ALL/plot/src/wi) has:

C        ISPEED - WIND SPEED OUTPUT FLAG                  
C                    =0 ; NO WIND SPEED OUTPUT
C                    =1 ; USE CONSTANT STRESS TO SPEED FACTOR (WVSCAL)
C                    =2 ; USE KARA      SPEED-DEPENDENT SCALE FACTOR  
C                    =3 ; USE COARE 3.0 SPEED-DEPENDENT SCALE FACTOR  

The ISPEED.EQ.2 case is as you have above, and there is currently no 
ISPEED.EQ.3 case (i.e. this has not been implemented).

HYCOM does not internally calculate wind speed from wind stress, but it 
can calculate ustar from wind speed and this requires a cd:

c --- 'ustrmn' = minimum ustar
      parameter (ustrmn=1.0e-5,

        elseif (ustflg.eq.2) then !ustar from wndspd, variable cd
          wsph = min( wsmax, max( wsmin, wind ) )
          cd0  = 0.862e-3 + 0.088e-3 * wsph - 0.00089e-3 * wsph**2
          rair = pairc / (rgas * ( tzero + airt ))
          ustar(i,j)=sqrt(thref*cd0*rair)*wind

        ustar( i,j)=max(ustrmn,ustar(i,j))

I think this CD is the inverse of the above formulation (i.e. Kara for
neutral conditions).

When we use the COARE algorithm for CL, we have been extracting ustar
from wind stress - so the above calculation from wind speed is not used.
Note that it is almost EXACTLY correct when the original wind speed was
calculated using the ISPEED.EQ.2 option to wi, because then both
wind speed and ustar are from wind stress assuming neutral conditions.
